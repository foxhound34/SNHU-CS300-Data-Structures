Data Structures

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The problem to be solved was to build a program with a menu system that had the ability to display a course list and be searchable.  The searchable data must show the requested course and any prerequisites assigned to that course. The purpose of project one was to determine the runtime complexity of three data structures (Vector, hash table, BST) as it pertains to the opening, reading, and printing from a text or CSV file.  The reason for doing this was to look at how code lines affect the speed of algorithms and the data structures holding that dat to be accessed.  I was then asked to decide on which structure I thought was best to use for project 2. 

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
In my analysis of the runtime complexity, I determined that the vector sort would be the fastest, however, I chose to make a BST because I liked that an inOrder call would print the tree alphanumerically without much additional work.  Learning data structures is important because the world in made up of data and how you store and read that data is important.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
A lot of trial and error.  I think I coded the reading and parsing of the file 4 different ways and went to the tutors 5 times. In the end, it was the code provided by the professor that helped me get over the hump.  I still had work to do on it, but the code logic helped a lot.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
I determined that I still have a lot to learn about even some of the simplest tasks and that code design can have implications on how fast a program runs.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I tried to keep as much code out of main as possible, however, I do always choose to put menus in main as I find it easier to read.  OOP would be easy to do in this instance, but I felt it was unnecessary in this instance.
